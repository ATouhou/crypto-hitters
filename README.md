# Crypto Hitters

I started Crypto Hitters to solve a problem.

Like many people I check the price moves of various Crypto assets every day. More times than not I then navigate to Reddit to see if I can find out what caused the move. This app is my way of tying together price movements with the news/gossip that may have caused them.
